                            <p>Shintō is the indigenous religious belief and practices of Japan. The word Shintō, which means "the way of kami" (generally sacred or divine power, specifically the various gods or deities), came into use to distinguish indigenous Japanese beliefs from Buddhism, which had been introduced into Japan in the 6th century CE. Shintō has no founder, no official sacred scriptures in the strict sense, and no fixed dogmas, but it has preserved its guiding beliefs throughout the ages.</p>
                            <p>Shintō can be roughly classified into the following three major types: Shrine Shintō, Sect Shintō, and Folk Shintō. Shrine Shintō (Jinja Shintō), which has been in existence from the beginning of Japanese history to the present day, constitutes the primary current of Shintō tradition. Shrine Shintō includes within its structure the now-defunct State Shintō (Kokka Shintō)—based on the real identity of religion and state—and has close relations with the Japanese Imperial family. Sect Shintō (Kyōha Shintō) is a relatively new movement consisting of 13 powerful sects that originated in Japan around the 19th century and of several others that emerged after World War II. Each denomination was organized into a religious body by either a founder or a systematizer. Folk Shintō (Minzoku Shintō) is an aspect of Japanese folk belief closely connected with the other types of Shintō. It has no formal organizational structure nor doctrinal formulation but is centered in awe of small roadside images and the agricultural rites of rural families. These three types of Shintō are interrelated: Folk Shintō exists as the substructure of Shintō faith, and a Sect Shintō follower is usually also a parishioner (Fujiko) of a particular Shintō shrine.</p><br>

                            <p>Buddhism originated in India in the 6th century BC. It consists of the teachings of the Buddha, Gautama Siddhartha. Of the main branches of Buddhism, it is the Mahayana or "Greater Vehicle" Buddhism, which found its way to Japan.</p>
                            <p>Today, roughly two-thirds of the Japanese population consider themselves Buddhists. However, religion does not directly affect the everyday life of the average Japanese very strongly. Funerals are usually carried out in a Buddhist way, and many households keep a small house altar to pay respect to their ancestors. </p>
                            <p>Japan's popular schools of Buddhism are Pure Land Buddhism, Nichiren Buddhism, Shingon Buddhism, and Zen. As of 2008, approximately 34% of the Japanese identify as Buddhists, and the number has been growing since the 1980s in terms of membership in organized religion. However, in terms of practice, 75% practice some form of Buddhism (compared with 90% practicing Shinto, thus most Japanese practice both faiths to some extent (Shinbutsu-shūgō)). About 60% of the Japanese have a Butsudan (Buddhist shrine) in their homes.</p>

                            <p>Shintō is the indigenous religious belief and practices of Japan. The word Shintō, which means "the way of kami" (generally sacred or divine power, specifically the various gods or deities), came into use to distinguish indigenous Japanese beliefs from Buddhism, which had been introduced into Japan in the 6th century CE. Shintō has no founder, no official sacred scriptures in the strict sense, and no fixed dogmas, but it has preserved its guiding beliefs throughout the ages.</p>
                            <p>Shintō can be roughly classified into the following three major types: Shrine Shintō, Sect Shintō, and Folk Shintō. Shrine Shintō (Jinja Shintō), which has been in existence from the beginning of Japanese history to the present day, constitutes the primary current of Shintō tradition. Shrine Shintō includes within its structure the now-defunct State Shintō (Kokka Shintō)—based on the real identity of religion and state—and has close relations with the Japanese Imperial family. Sect Shintō (Kyōha Shintō) is a relatively new movement consisting of 13 powerful sects that originated in Japan around the 19th century and of several others that emerged after World War II. Each denomination was organized into a religious body by either a founder or a systematizer. Folk Shintō (Minzoku Shintō) is an aspect of Japanese folk belief closely connected with the other types of Shintō. It has no formal organizational structure nor doctrinal formulation but is centered in awe of small roadside images and the agricultural rites of rural families. These three types of Shintō are interrelated: Folk Shintō exists as the substructure of Shintō faith, and a Sect Shintō follower is usually also a parishioner (Fujiko) of a particular Shintō shrine.</p><br>

                        <div class="col-12">
                            <p>Sushi traces its origins back for millennia, to the rice fields of Asia – China, to be specific. This may be shocking to you, as most people assume that sushi was first created in Japan. However, this is not the case. While Japan is certainly the sushi capital of the world – and responsible for introducing the dish to travelers – sushi traces its origins back to a Chinese dish called narezushi.</p>
                            <p>This dish consisted of fermented rice and salted fish. And, despite what you may think, it wasn’t fermented and salted for flavor. The dish’s earliest known origin was in the 2nd century BC – so it predates refrigerators by nearly 2,000 years.</p>
                            <p>Because of this, narezushi was actually a very practical dish. The rice was fermented to preserve it, and the fish was also salted heavily to prevent the growth of bacteria and microorganisms – keeping it fresh longer, even when stored without any kind of refrigeration. And, interestingly, the rice was typically thrown out when eating the fish. It was used only to wrap and preserve the fish.</p>

                            <p>The history of anime in Japan goes back further than one might think. It's further than the iconic Astro Boy of the 1960s and even earlier than when it was common for televisions to be in people's homes, even before World War II. Anime's roots can be found going back to the early 1900s.</p>
                            <p>It's hard to know precisely when the first piece of animation was created in Japan. Many of the film reels from that time have been lost either from natural disasters like the Great Kantō Earthquake back in 1923 or World War II.</p><br>

                            <p>Video games are a living element of Japanese popular culture. The video game industry has begun to dominate Japan since the 1978s and has long dominated the world market. In this article, we will talk a little about the influence of Games in Japan.</p>
                            <p>The 2 Japanese companies dominated the world market for games, Nintendo has remained at the top for many years. Still, maintaining traditionalism and Japanese culture has lost the war abroad. Sony did precisely the opposite, surrendered to Western culture, and launched games with a more realistic or battle theme.</p>
                            <p>Thousands of manga and anime games are produced every year, most of them are Visual Novel, it is still possible to find good adventure, fighting, and strategy games. Most of these games are released on notebooks, mainly Sony's.</p>

                            <p>The most iconic and easily recognisable of all traditional Japanese wear, the kimono (着物) is still a staple piece for many Japanese people and is growing in international appeal too. Drawing influence from ancient Chinese style clothing, the kimono was worn initially with a hakama, a long skirt type piece that sometimes featured a divider down the middle. Over time, however, tastes changed and it became far more popular for the kimono to be worn without the skirt and instead held together with a sash known as an obi. Typically worn for special occasions, both traditional and contemporary, the kimono has stood the test of time, its flattering and body-hugging silhouette is a timeless representation of Japan’s great appreciation for carefully considered beauty.</p><br>

Made from soft, lightweight fabric like cotton, the garment's name translates to bathing cloth, for which it was originally created. Worn by men and women the yukata is fastened by a sash (obi) and is very easy to wear. It is most popularly worn while onsen bathing, and this stylish and breezy robe is also the unofficial garb for vibrant summer matsuri events during the sweltering summer months.</p>

                            <p>Also known as sangen, the Chinese sanxian made its way via Okinawa to Japan. As per the name, it has three strings, and in China and Okinawa, they were covered in snakeskin, while in mainland Japan, cat and dog skin is used. While only used in Japan since modern times, from kabuki theatre, puppet plays, and other such theatre music, accompaniment to singing, and folk songs from many regions, the shamisen is widely loved.</p><br>
                            <p>There is a variety of standard shamisen which vary according to the genre from hosozao (thin neck) to futazao (thick neck) and also a diverse range of bachi, plectrums, and Koma, bridges. Also characteristic is the formation of a lingering resonance called sawari, from the string lightly touching the surface of the neck when striking the strings, knocking the plectrum on the skin. A diverse range of tunings, based on the perfect fourth and perfect fifth combined hon-chōshi tuning, including the second string raised one tone, ni-Edgar, and the third string lowered one tone, san-sagari.</p><br>

                        <div class="col-12">
                            <p>The shakuhachi is a type of vertical bamboo flute that takes its name from its standard length of one shaku eight suns, literally 1.8 Japanese feet (approx. 55cm). In China, there is a vertical flute, dosho/dongxiao. A shakuhachi with six holes used in gagaku, Japanese imperial court music in ancient times, is thought to have descended from this but has now disappeared.</p>
                            <p>The shakuhachi of today originated in the modern era (Edo period) from a five-hole fuke shakuhachi which was used as a spiritual tool by komusō, wandering Buddhist priests of the Fuke sect. Unlike the recorder, the shakuhachi has no mechanism to control the flow of air through the embouchure and thus requires accurate angle and lip shape in order to produce a sound. Based on the number of finger wholes, it would be expected to produce only a pentatonic scale; however, through the use of various fingerings, half holing, and by adapting the angle of the embouchure on the lips, a wide range of tones can be produced including a howling effect.</p>
